            <li>  
              <ul class="subList">
                <li>First in LA the network edited out a group of police officers being overly aggressive with a family who had been the ones who called the police for help. Fox played the clip as if the family were the aggressors.</li>
                <li>Fox has since used the same superimposed photo of a heavily armed white man twice. Fox have been called out for both incidents and removed the photos. Fox edited him over a photo in front of the CHAZ district in Seattle, then again in front of a shattered store front. Fox states that "Antifa" is protecting the "rioters" and not allowing the police to enter.</li>
                <li>Most recently they were called out by the <em>Times</em> when they used a photo from the riots in Minneapolis and ran a story about the peaceful protesting in Seattle. The photo shows the city burning and cars torched.</li>
                <li>The network stood by the photos as long as they could, calling them authentic. They have since came out and apologized for using as they put it "collages" of photos, and they "regret these errors."</li>

                <li>Many of their anchors say that the Black Lives Matter movement organizers are "profiteers."</li>
                <li>Tucker Carlson says Black Lives Matter protesters would be called "terrorist" if they were Saudi.</li>
                <li>Carlson has also called white supremacy a "hoax" and that the movement is "an attack on white people."</li>
                <li>Carlson attacked the Sesame Street special on "Coming Together: Standing Up to Racism", with his interpretation for white kids in America: "It's a children's show. Got that, Bobby? America is a very bad place and it's your fault, so no matter what happens, no matter what they do to you when you grow up, you have no right to complain."</li>
                <li>Laura Ingraham hosted Rudy Giuliani who had some less than choice words about the protests: "Black Lives Matter wants to come and take your house away from you. They want to take your property away from you... They are anarchists and they are anti-American."</li>

              <ul class="subList">
                <li>Several Anti-Racist groups have found their posts disappearing from their pages, and been booted from Facebook. Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesperson has said "These examples were enforcement mistakes, and they were certainly not intentional."</li>
                <li>Even with activist groups dealing with this it seems impossible to get any action from Facebook when there are unsubstantiated posts muddying the waters all over the place.</li>
                <li>The infamous posts coming from Trump, one in particular: "When the looting starts, the shooting starts". Twitter had immediately marked that post on their platform as a violation for glorifying violence. Facebook took no action, but has told everyone that they are reviewing their policies.</li>
                <li>There are a lot of misinformation campaigns in private groups which don't allow anyone to audit the messages being spread. There are over 600 million groups on Facebook with over one billion members.</li>
                <li>In June 2020, Facebook announced that they have removed almost 200 accounts related to "hate groups". I think that they still have a long way to go.</li>

                <li>As I mentioned earlier with Trump's tweet about the "looting, shooting" violated Twitter rules about glorifying violence. There are many more that have not been considered in this way, but have largely negative effects to the movement.</li>
                <li>Another example of his glorifying violence is when he told "the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together... or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right....."</li>
                <li>Trump posted an edited version of a great story GMA about two young children hugging each other. He twisted it, slapped a fake CNN logo in the corner and ran it as a racist propaganda ad. The parents of the children have requested it is taken down and Twitter responded promptly.</li>
                <li>He has also posted symbols resembling what Nazis made Jewish sympathizers where during one of the worst time eras in this planet's history. "Dangerous MOBS of far-left groups are running through our streets and causing absolute mayhem. They are DESTROYING our cities and rioting - its absolute madness." He wanted to force "Antifa" members where these patches.</li>
                <li>He also has repeatedly labeled protesters all around the country as "Antifa".</li>

                <li>We all watched what happened in Lafayette Square in June, while trump waddled his way to a church he has never been to, hold a bible that was not his. There were National Guardsmen, D.C. police stations, unmarked police officers, and surveillance airplanes flying over the protest. During the peaceful protest, the militarized officers and National guardsmen used rubber bullets, batons, shields, tear gas, and pepper spray so that he could take some pictures.</li>
                <li>Even before he became the President of the US, he had an interview with Bill O'Reilly and spoke about the Black Lives Matter movement saying "I think they're trouble. I think they're looking for trouble." he continued speaking about Democrats, "I think it's disgraceful the way they're being catered to by the Democrats... The fact is all lives matter."</li>
                <li>His son Eric during the highly publicized rally in Tulsa, OK was falsely claiming "..when you see these animals literally taking over our cities, burning down churches, this isn't America. That's not what Americans do."</li>
                <li>We Can not forget when Trump called what happened in Charlottesville, NC in 2017. "Some very fine people on both sides". When a alt-right Neo-Nazi group was marching through the streets with tiki torches and harassing the peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters. Remember that a fascist group American Vanguard member deliberately drove his vehicle into a crowd of protesters, killing a 32-year-old, Heather Heyer. "The press has treated them absolutely unfairly." He told the nation, claiming that the other group deserves an equal amount of the blame for the violence.</li>

        <h3>All Lives Matter & White Lives Matter & Blue Lives Matter?</h3>
        <p>I would first like to state that this section will entirely be my own opinion and in no way represents anyone or any group other than myself. With that being said I believe that White Lives Matter is a total slap in the face to everyone who is fighting for equality. This phrase and All Lives Matter never even existed until the Black Lives Matter movement was gaining momentum. These are a protest to a protest which are gross. It seems that All lives never mattered until you were told that Black Lives Matter. White people have never been the oppressed, why do we need to covet the sanctity of "white lives" when they are the blunt end of the harsh reality shaping this nation. This is extremely different than politicians who are timid to say anything controversial, so they say All lives Matter. When politicians say All Lives Matter I see that as an attempt to appease white people, without saying White Lives Matter, I'm not agreeing with them or even accepting it, but saying White Lives Matter goes far beyond that. There are plenty of people and politicians who also use All Lives Matter in a derogatory way, especially when they can't even muster saying Black Lives Matter (I'm looking at you, Vice President Pence).</p>
        <p>This brings me to a much different topic of Blue Lives Matter, this one is touchy and rightfully so. No one can say that an officer doesn't put their lives on the line when they put on those colors and badge, however those same colors and badge protect them as well. Their nation-wide goal is clear; Homicide against a police officer should be a "hate crime" in the court room. This is where things get blurry because in the state of N. Carolina and other states it still is not a hate crime to call someone a N--R, which is bizarre to me. The ACLU criticizes this a lot because it changes the definition of "hate crime" to include a career choice, which is a choice, unlike race, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Louisiana has passed such laws making it a hate crime to even target any first-responders with any sort of violence. Which is redundant seeing how there is already harsher punishment nation-wide for attacking officers. The term Blue Lives Matter is nearly synonymous with "thin blue line" which has a military past and a rocky revival. William Henry Parker III, known as "Los Angeles' greatest and most controversial chief of police". Although he is credited with desegregating the LAPD, he is more so known for racist tendencies in his department which is the root of the Watts riot. His decisions wound up killing 21 people from police and National Guard bullets, with also over 1,000 people injured and nearly 3,500 arrests. He referred to the rioters as "monkeys in a zoo" among numerous other racist AF comments about "negro" population growing in LA, and saying Latinos criminal behavior "not being too far removed from the wild tribes". There are many police stations who have embraced the black American flag with the "thin blue line" which has caused a lot of controversy. I must say that there are also many Commissioners who aware of the divisiveness of this symbol and have banned officers from wearing such images, and from flying the "thin blue line" flag at their departments.</p>
