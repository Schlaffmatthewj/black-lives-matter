                <h5>Important Note</h5><br>
                <p>The steep decrease in percentages of the white population incarcerated does not completely correlate with the tapering off of the black population, this is primarily because of a sharp increase in the Hispanic population. This does not prove or disprove anything here, except to help show how we are feeding these prisons and jails with a steady flow of minority groups.</p>

    			<img src="assets/photos/trayvon.jpeg" alt="Trayvon Martin">
    			<p>Trayvon Benjamin Martin was a 17-year old African-American who lived in Florida. Trayvon was gunned down By George Zimmerman who was a member of the community watch. Trayvon was walking back from a convenience store to where his father's fiancee's home. Zimmerman called the police reporting suspicious activity by Trayvon, and the Police to Zimmerman to stand down and do not proceed. Zimmerman continued to follow Trayvon until an altercation took place that ended with Trayvon being shot in the chest and dying of his wounds. Zimmerman was not immediately arrested or charged. This saddened the Nation and people from every corner of this Country had an opinion about what had taken place. Zimmerman did eventually face charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Unfortunately the Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman of all charges in the case. The now sad Nation became <strong>enraged</strong> by this verdict, which lead to groups being formed for social justice.</p>

		    	<p>Alicia Garza did not fall into this situation by chance, she was raised in a mixed-race and mixed-religion household. Throughout her years in High school she was an activist for promoting school sex education about birth control. Then while attending the University of California, San Diego she was had a active role in the student association. As a senior at the university she helped organize the first Women of Color Conference in 2002, while graduating with a degree in anthropology and sociology. Following the acquittal of Zimmerman in 2013, Garza along with Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors took to social media to express how heartbroken they were. One of Garza first posts regarding this case read "I continue to be surprised at how little Black lives matter... Our lives matter." This post was shared by Cullors along with the #BlackLivesMatter. This was the first usage of the hashtag and the start of a movement they could only dream of.</p>

        <div><img src="assets/photos/policeReform.jpeg" class="policeReform" alt="militarized policing reforms"><p><span>Full and Partial Bans on Choke holds, Duty to Intervene, Disciplinary Reporting, No-Knock Warrants, Re-funneling Funds</span> In the wake of George Floyd's death and subsequent protest across the nation, dozens of cities and a handful of states have updated or even completely changed their policy regarding the use of choke holds and the responsibilities of an arresting officer. Smaller cities have seen changes regarding a "duty" to intervene and report excessive force by fellow officers, punishable by criminal prosecution. For too long police discipline records have been kept secret, even after an officer is removed from an office, the next station may not be aware of the reasons for the removal. New York has unburdened themselves of one such law, with Massachusetts and some cities following suit. Louisville, KY following Breonna Taylor's killing has voted to ban all no-knock warrants. Many cities have began shifting money from their police department into other institutions that have proven to be a great alternative to calling the police for non-criminal and non-violent calls. New York City has also proposed a $1 billion funding cut to their departments.</p>
