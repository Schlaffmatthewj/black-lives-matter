            <h5>Eric Garner</h5>
    		<div class="ericGarner"><img src="assets/photos/ericGarner.jpeg" alt="Protests for Eric Garner"><p>Eric Garner's death drew so much attention from the world, not only because of the tragic nature of which he had died but because of the presence of the people in New York. Voices came from all across the country to participate in the protest of his death and the grand juries decision not to indict Pantaleo, the officer who killed Garner. Even the police had taken notice to the large crowds and had infiltrate the groups with undercover officers. Black Lives Matter has organized many events throughout the years representing Eric Garner. Documents requested through NY's Freedom of Information Law showed undercover police at 25 separate protests spanning two years. Even this couldn't deter the message protesters wanted <strong>AWARENESS!</strong> They wanted to start the conversation, no matter how uncomfortable it made you feel. Celebrities had even taken it upon themselves to show support by wear "I Can't Breathe" t-shirt while warming up on live television. Kobe Byrant, Lebron James, and President Obama were very outspoken during these times. Even with all this kind of support it was harder than ever to make any changes. They could stage "die-ins" in Grand Central Terminal or even shut-down roadways and bridges, but unless the people in charge who have the pen in their hand care, then nothing happens but noise. This was unfortunately not the first time a victim begged for a breath as a result to policing. The New York Times reports the phrase has been used by over 70 victims of police brutality. "<span>I Can't Breathe</span>"</p>

            <h5>Michael Brown</h5>
    		<div class="michaelBrown"><img src="assets/photos/michaelBrown.jpeg" alt="Protests for Michael Brown"><p>The very day that Michael Brown lost his life already protesters were taking to the streets. These initial protests were met by militarized police officers in full riot gear. Any educated person understands that this is not a way to defuse a situation, quite the opposite happened. The people were already frustrated with the police and then with this type of response things became much worse with vandalism and looting. Three days after Brown's death again President Obama made a public statement offering his condolences to Brown's family. The ACLU sued the Ferguson for the release of the police report and any other findings on the 15<sup>th</sup>. The officer involved did not file an incident report nor did the police department file a use-of-force report. By this point in our nation 80% of blacks and only 37% of whites believed that race was a factor in the fatal shooting. This aside during the protests in Ferguson the #BlackLivesMatter transformed from the hashtag to a public outcry then all the way into the national movement you see on television today. On the 30<sup>th</sup> Black Lives Matter had organized a march in Ferguson and Twitter saw it's first real presence of re-tweets flooding in. However before the grand jury's declined to charge the officer the # had only been used under 2,500 times, that day it was used more than 100,000 times. "<span>Hand's Up, Don't Shoot</span>"</p>

            <h5>Tamir Rice</h5>
    		<div class="tamirRice"><img src="assets/photos/tamirRice.jpeg" alt="Protests for Tamir Rice"><p>If killing a 12-year-old boy wasn't enough, Tamir's sister 14, was tackled, forced to the ground and handcuffed because she was running to her brother laying on the ground in the middle of a playground. AND if that is not enough they then threatened Tamir's mother was arrest if she didn't "calm down". The officer who killed Tamir was just fired by the neighboring town's police department after being deemed an "emotionally unstable recruit and unfit for duty." There was no immediate first aid applied to Tamir either, AND THEN on the ride to the hospital Tamir's mother was told to "Stop touching him, because his body is evidence." (this one was especially hard to read about and try to convey properly) Back to the Black Live Matter movement, after the grand jury decision to not indict the police officer the protests grew rapidly along with media coverage spanning the globe. The Cleveland chapter of Black Lives Matter organized a protest on New Year's Day at the home of the county prosecutor, Timothy McGinty. They were holding signs calling for McGinty to be fired and laid down on the sidewalk outside of his house for four minutes, which was the amount of time that passed before anyone touched him.

            <h5>Sandra Bland</h5>
    		<div class="sandraBland"><img src="assets/photos/sandraBland.jpeg" alt="Protests for Sandra Bland"><p>Sandra Bland was pulled over for failing to indicate a change of lanes and eventually arrested for assaulting an officer. We wouldn't be here talking about her today if that was the case. After a review of the dash cam footage the officer was placed on administrative leave for failing to follow proper traffic stop procedures. He was eventually fired after national outrage from the footage being released. Three days later Sandra was found dead inside her jail cell, which was declared a suicide. She even had tried to record the whole encounter with the officer which actually infuriated the officer, she eventually turned it off and then things went downhill from there. It took four years for the police to release the footage from Sandra's phone, which has actually spurred new calls for further investigation. Sandra suffered from PTSD and the jail guards shirked their timely check-ins. Over a hundred people were outside of the jail protesting, wanting answers and an investigation. After the investigations into her death it was found that the jail grossly failed in their duties. There are many questions that still remain in this case. "<span>Say Her Name</span>"</p>

            <h5>Philando Castile</h5>
    		<div class="philandoCastile"><img src="assets/photos/philandoCastile.jpeg" alt="Protests for Philando Castile"><p>July 7, 2016, within three hours of the fatal shooting that was Facebook live streamed by Diamond Reynolds there was more than 200 protesters at the location of the shooting. In the video you can hear Philando call out that he has a license to carry a firearm, and the conversation went back and forth about his gun and his explanation that he was grabbing his wallet. After two days of peaceful protests and vigils tensions grew between the protesters and the police presence on the streets. In a period of two days over 100 protesters were arrested. President Obama spoke about the shooting saying actions like these are "not isolated incidents" but were "symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system". More than 2,000 people marched peacefully down the streets in St Paul, MN and eventually were blocking intersections and a major highway. Police were using pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the crowds off of the highway. "<span>Unite for Philando</span>"</p>

            <h5>George Floyd</h5>
    		<div class="georgeFloyd"><img src="assets/photos/georgeFloyd.jpeg" alt="Protests for George Floyd"><p>May 25<sup>th</sup> 2020, George Floyd was not the first and unfortunately he will not be the last black man to die in police custody. In the public opinion chart on the home page you can see the sudden increase in support for Black Lives Matter. This is not just because there is "more" racism in America, but it is being filmed by witnesses who can share or live stream events. George was pinned to the ground by several officers while laying still on the ground. At which point does resisting arrest become fight for your life, or when did some police officers lose the ability to read a situation. Chauvin and Tau aside, those other two officers did not "serve and protect". As you may very well know protests have been continuously going on <strong>Worldwide</strong> since George's death. This seems to be the final straw that broke the camel's back. Protests are being heard more than ever, there are motives and goals that ring true in every neighborhood. Even the US Congress seems to be waking up. "<span>Black Lives Matter</span>"</p>
